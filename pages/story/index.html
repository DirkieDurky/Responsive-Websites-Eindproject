    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
        I short Celeste is a game about Madeline. A girl with ambition to climb Celeste Mountain.
        On her way to the top she gets to know a handful of people, but she most importantly gets to know herself.
        Below, we explain the story of Celeste per chapter.

            <h3>A-Side</h3>
            <p>
                Forsaken City's A-Side serves as an introductory level to much of how the game works. Madeline,
                controlled
                by the
                player, is introduced to combining jumping, dashing, and climbing to make it through various rooms.
                Strawberries,
                cassette tapes, crystal hearts, dash-refilling crystals, and many other objects are all introduced here.
                Momentum is
                another core mechanic that is presented.
                <br><br>
                Three sub-chapters are present: Start, Crossing, and Chasm.
            </p>
            <h3>Start</h3>
            <p>
                The beginning of "Start" introduces the player to several basic mechanics. The second room introduces
                wall
                jumping,
                which occurs when Madeline jumps from one wall to another; it's the simplest way to climb without using
                stamina.
                <br><br>
                Zippers, also known as "traffic light blocks" first appear in the fourth room. Jumping too soon whilst
                the
                block is
                moving will result in Madeline being thrown into a wall of spikes; this is the player's first
                introduction
                to momentum.
                The next room after features a winged strawberry; dashing will result in it flying away, and as such,
                Madeline must jump
                on the disappearing platforms right of the berry to collect it. The next room features a light shining
                at
                the left. It's
                the first occurrence of a "berry room", a room outside the main path containing a strawberry.
                <br><br>
                Springs, which bounce Madeline in the direction the spring is pointing towards, and smashable walls,
                which
                may be dashed
                into to remove, are also introduced here. Six strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.
            </p>
            <h3>Crossing</h3>
            <p>
                At the beginning of this subchapter, take the path left, and use the dash refill diamond to dash twice
                leftwards. This
                will lead into a room with a tent, where Theo is hiding. Diamonds refill your dash mid-air.
                <br><br>
                Later during this subchapter, falling ice blocks make a reappearance. 9 strawberries are hidden in this
                subchapter, and
                so is the Crystal Heart.
            </p>
            <h3>Chasm</h3>
            <p>
                The final subchapter contains several slightly more intricate uses of zippers. A Cassette Tape unlocking
                the
                B-Side can
                be found here.
                <br><br>
                Five strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.
            </p>

    <h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
    <div class="hor-flex">
        <div class="column">
            After leaving the city, Madeline goes to explore some old ruins. Many things have changed since she woke up;
            the
            campfire is now green, the Celeste Memorial is now rearranging itself, and the sky has gained blue lights.
            <br><br>
            After exploring the ruins for a bit, the player finds a mirror in which they see a twisted reflection of
            themselves.
            Attempting to leave the room afterward, the reflection breaks out of the mirror and runs away, activating
            the dream
            blocks, allowing Madeline to reach more places and explore much of the ruins. Later, after climbing up to a
            higher level
            of the ruins, she finds the reflection.
            <br><br>
            Badeline introduces itself as a "part of her" (Madeline). She tells Maddy that it is a relief to finally get
            out of her
            head, and tells Madeline that they shouldn't climb the mountain. Badeline states that she is the pragmatic
            part and that
            she is trying to be diplomatic, but as soon as Madeline starts running afterward, Badeline starts chasing
            her, forcing
            her to move continuously.
            <br><br>
            After a ten-room-long chase, Madeline finally escapes the ruins. Upon leaving the spire, Badeline stops,
            laughing at
            her, and then disappears. Not far away Madeline finds a station and a payphone, which starts ringing. Upon
            answering, a
            green-haired person, internally known as Madeline's ex, on the other side answers the call with a
            smartphone; they think
            Madeline called them from a payphone, but Madeline claims the opposite, that they are calling her. She
            explains that
            someone (Badeline) is chasing her and she doesn't understand what's going on. The green-haired person says
            that Madeline
            is making it up. Madeline describes what happened in more detail, soon realizing it's all a dream. She then
            hangs up and
            gets angry, Badeline appears and tells her to stop climbing the mountain, and upon her disappearing, the
            payphone turns
            into a monster that eats Madeline whole.
            <br><br>
            Madeline then wakes up next to the campfire. Theo can be seen; Madeline may talk to her about her previous
            nightmare. He
            shows her pictures he took in the ruins, and then they take a selfie (against Madeline's wishes because she
            isn't
            photogenic). He describes how his grandpa was semi-famous in the photography world and that's why he tried
            photography.
            Once Madeline arrives at the payphone, she calls her mother and tells her she is a bit overwhelmed by
            everything that
            has occurred so far.
            <br><br>
            “Oh! We need to formally commemorate this occasion... Take a selfie with me!”
            ~ Theo
            <br><br>
            If Madeline has never seen Theo before, or has seen Theo but never talked to him, special dialogue
            references how it's
            their first encounter; apart from that, no narrative differences occur.

        <div class="column">
            After leaving the ruins, Madeline arrives at a hotel. There, she finds a bell with a note saying "Please
            Ring for
            Service", and she rings it. The lights go down and a ghost appears, introducing himself as the concierge
            of
            the
            "world-renowned Celestial Resort Hotel": Mr. Oshiro. He asks Madeline for the length of her stay, to
            which
            she replies
            that she wants to leave and continue climbing the mountain. This makes Oshiro a bit concerned about
            losing a
            guest, so
            he tells Madeline that there is a world-class view of the peak in their presidential suite and offers to
            guide her to
            the room.
            <br><br>
            After traversing a few rooms, Madeline tells him that the hotel is in pretty rough shape. Soon after,
            Madeline finds
            herself in a messy room full of clothes, books, and crates. Oshiro starts getting worried, realizing the
            hotel is a huge
            mess. After realizing he can't clean the whole resort alone, he gives up, but Madeline helps him. When
            Madeline starts
            cleaning, Oshiro thinks it's the power of positive thinking; however, Madeline tells him that it was her
            who
            cleaned
            some of the clutter. Eventually, Madeline can find a paper hidden under a pile of clothes, informing the
            hotel staff
            that the Celestial Resort is closing; this explains part of why the hotel is in such shape. She can also
            find Theo
            crawling through the vents to escape the hotel, telling her to stop helping Oshiro; this fails to work,
            and
            Madeline
            continues cleaning. If Madeline has never seen or never talked to Theo before, she will introduce
            herself
            first; if she
            has ignored him despite having seen him in either Forsaken City or Old Site, she will additionally
            apologize
            for being
            antisocial.
            <br><br>
            After cleaning up all the mess, Oshiro guides her to the presidential suite, where, en route, she again
            finds Theo
            telling her to leave. A bit later, she can encounter Oshiro leaking dust bunnies out of his head due to
            nervousness,
            blocking the shortcut. This explains where all of the dust bunnies came from. Upon Madeline reaching the
            suite, she
            tells Oshiro that it is beautiful solely to avoid disappointing him (he doesn't realize this). Maddy
            then
            again states
            her intent, that she wants to leave to continue climbing the mountain. Oshiro's nervousness continues to
            manifest and
            makes it so that he'll give Madeline a discount. She declines, stating that she wishes to continue
            climbing
            the
            mountain.
            <br><br>
            Oshiro begs her to stay in the hotel but is quickly interrupted by Badeline, who appears in the mirror
            and
            then proceeds
            to shatter it, telling Oshiro that he is a loser and that the hotel is the worst place she's ever seen.
            Madeline
            attempts to calm down Oshiro, who soon enough ends up snapping and lashing out at her. Badeline tries to
            convince Maddy
            that she shouldn't be helping the creepy weirdo that Oshiro is.
            <br><br>
            “This resort is a dump. No one would ever want to stay here.”
            ~ Badeline, talking to Oshiro
            <br><br>
            Soon after, Oshiro starts attacking Madeline while she tries to escape the hotel on the rooftop. After a
            long chase
            sequence, Oshiro breaks the roof and makes Madeline fall onto the ground with him; he subsequently
            explains
            that he
            knows the hotel is a total mess and was supposed to be closed for repairs and asks her to leave him
            alone.

    <h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
    <div class="hor-flex">
        <div class="column">
            After escaping the Celestial Resort, Madeline arrives at a ridge climbing up the side of Celeste
            Mountain.
            En route, she
            ends up finding the Bird, who chirps a single time, and Granny. Both end up surprised when seeing
            each
            other; Granny
            wasn't expecting Madeline to make it this far, and Madeline thought she was just crazy. Granny then
            asks
            Madeline
            whether she made it out of the hotel and whether she saw Mr. Oshiro or no; Maddy explains that she
            was
            chased out of
            there. Granny then tells Madeline that Mr. Oshiro is a lost soul. Madeline, however, thinks that the
            hotel
            has driven
            both her and Oshiro crazy. The old woman then comments on how someone else had told them this; this
            person
            might be
            Theo. She then continues to talk about how the mountain cannot bring out anything that isn't already
            within
            you; in
            Madeline's case, her insecurities are fully manifesting themselves. After receiving another comment
            about
            how crazy she
            was, Granny tells the mountain climber about a shortcut she knows back to her car if she decides to
            give
            up.
            Madeline
            then directly walks past her, stating that she's headed for the summit; the old woman then comments
            that
            it
            is tough to
            tell apart stubbornness and determination (these two terms are reused as chapter names in Farewell).
            Before
            ending the
            conversation, she tells her to "watch out for the wind."
            <br><br>
            If Madeline continues talking to Granny, she'll ask about whether she gets many visitors; the answer
            is
            no.
            The mountain
            climber then comments about how she would want to live the same way and how she genuinely wanted to
            help
            Mr.
            Oshiro.
            Granny then comments again about how there's "no hope" in saving him. Madeline then asks if she is
            fine
            living alone in
            her old cabin; Granny says that she has friends and isn't a hermit. She then comments about how she
            found
            the mountain
            and knew instantly it should be her home because it shows you who you are (reiterating what she
            previously
            said).
            <br><br>
            Madeline then continues up the Golden Ridge. The wind becomes increasingly stronger as she makes it
            upwards
            until it
            eventually reaches a point where she can barely move against the wind, and snowballs start
            bombarding
            her.
            <br><br>
            “Nailed it.”
            ~ Theo, after falling down a cliff
            <br><br>
            At the end of the chapter, Madeline finds a gondola, but then, Theo appears, falling from above. He
            then
            gets excited
            from seeing the gondola and suggests taking it to cross a relatively deep valley to another side.
            Whilst
            riding the
            gondola, Theo then asks about how did it go with Oshiro; Madeline then tells her the truth, to which
            Theo
            replies, "I
            hate to say this, but...". Madeline interrupts him, knowing that she should've listened. Theo then
            comments
            that they
            have to get a selfie up here. As they take a photo, the gondola stalls out, and Badeline appears at
            the
            top
            of it. Theo
            breaks a lever trying to get the gondola working; Madeline then starts panicking, commenting that
            "this
            really isn't
            good". The music, 10 • Anxiety, intensifies. Theo says that she's having a panic attack, to which
            Madeline
            angrily asks
            him why he thought it's a good idea to ride "this stupid thing". Theo calms her down and brings up a
            technique taught to
            him by Carlos (his grandfather), imagining a feather floating up and down. This helps reduce the
            panic,
            and
            as soon as
            she's back to a state of relative normalcy, the gondola continues going to its destination. When
            they
            arrive, Madeline
            thanks Theo, who states that he thought that the gondola wouldn't continue, and shows her the selfie
            he
            took.

            Mirror Temple is a pivotal chapter in Celeste's story since it's where Madeline's personality
            starts
            truly
            unraveling
            (unlike before, where only hints were displayed). This chapter takes place in the titular Mirror
            Temple,
            an
            ancient
            temple that concentrates Celeste Mountain's power.
            <br><br>
            Madeline's ventures into the Mirror Temple weren't "voluntary", unlike prior chapters. She
            enters the
            temple
            to follow
            Theo, who ventures into the temple himself to snap a few photos. Madeline is clearly shown to
            doubt this
            idea, having a
            bad feeling about this. Shortly after entering, Madeline discovers Theo's phone in front of a
            mirror;
            this
            quickly
            increases her worries.
            <br><br>
            The initial section of the Mirror Temple, albeit brightly lit, does exhibit isolation. In
            contrast to
            Celestial Resort,
            the music does not change when doors are unlocked: Madeline is truly "lost" within the temple
            during
            this
            time. A soft
            yet slightly eerie piano piece, which forms a portion of 11 • Quiet and Falling, plays
            throughout this
            section.
            <br><br>
            A few mazy corridors later, Madeline discovers Theo trapped behind a mirror; she quickly
            displays
            concern.
            Theo, on the
            other hand, sees Madeline as on the other side of the mirror: his reality is inverted. He
            attempts to
            unveil
            what
            happened but eventually faces a threat, having to abandon Madeline once again. She's truly on
            her own
            now.
            The music
            shifts and the piano mostly disappears, further amplifying this sense of "being lost". The
            second
            checkpoint, Depths, is
            very dark (compared to the rest of the temple): it is extremely difficult to see without
            lighting up the
            torches first.
            However, despite all this, Maddy's fears do not demonstrate themselves.
            <br><br>
            This all changes following the mirror cutscene, which plays between Depths and Unraveling. The
            music, 12
            •
            In the
            Mirror, becomes significantly eerier, and Madeline starts panicking again. Confronted by
            Badeline, Maddy
            instantly lays
            the guilt upon her, but unlike all previous chapters, she is mistaken: Badeline is not to blame.
            Badeline
            then explains
            how she's not the only "creepy thing" living in Madeline's head, and that the temple carries the
            same
            powers
            as the
            mountain itself. Madeline eventually starts panicking, then snaps and gets angry at her other
            self
            before
            reiterating
            that she could do this on her own.
            <br><br>
            “I'm a trespasser in my own world.”
            ~ Madeline
            <br><br>
            The next few rooms feature plenty of Seeker, another product of Madeline's self. She eventually
            reaches
            another mirror,
            where she sees herself, albeit outside of the mirror; she quickly starts degrading herself but
            is
            stopped by
            this
            reflection, which tells her to "get up" and save Theo. Later on, she finds Theo behind a pair of
            spinners,
            trapped in a
            crystal; he displays glee at Madeline's sight, but also displays concern that she wouldn't be
            able to
            save
            him. Maddy,
            on the other hand, expresses her embarrassment at how she has unraveled so significantly.
            <br><br>
            Later on, Madeline finally manages to make it to the room Theo is in. She tries to break the
            crystal,
            but
            fails to do
            so; she chooses to carry it instead. As they escape, Theo makes a variety of comments, praising
            or
            encouraging Madeline,
            or commenting about Seekers and the level itself. Theo breaks free from the crystal after being
            thrown
            into
            a giant
            eyeball at the end of the temple.

        <div class="column">
            Reflection begins immediately after the events of Mirror Temple. Madeline puts Theo down a
            little after
            the
            temple, as
            the sun is setting, on a small rock bridge. She then lights a campfire, which shoots out red
            flames.
            <br><br>
            Sometime in the middle of the night, Theo wakes up and recalls having had a nightmare.
            Madeline greets
            her
            enthusiastically. Theo then realizes that it all actually happened; however, apart from "an
            existential
            crisis", he's
            fine now. Madeline then explains to him about Badeline and her influence. To her surprise,
            Theo does
            trust
            her. Thanking
            him in the process, Maddy then asks how Theo can trust her so quickly; it's because of how
            similar she
            is to
            Alex,
            Theo's sister, and because of her extreme determination. When Theo asks why Madeline is
            climbing the
            mountain, she
            reveals that she is trying to escape the dark thoughts she has and is attempting to avoid
            depression and
            panic attacks,
            using the Internet to lash out and drinking alcohol to cope.
            <br><br>
            “I'm good at keeping up appearances, but the truth is I'm barely holding it together.”
            ~ Madeline
            When describing what depression feels like to Theo, Maddy states it's like being at the
            bottom of the
            ocean,
            not seeing
            anything, feeling claustrophobic yet exposed, and constantly fighting yourself. Theo
            attempts to
            convince
            Madeline that
            she's, after all, a good person. Maddy then states that she wishes to get rid of Badeline to
            be "free"
            again; Theo
            suggests that Madeline could learn to control her instead. When Theo asks why not take a
            vacation
            instead,
            Madeline
            tells him that it would be unproductive and that she needs a challenge. When she asks why
            Theo went to
            the
            mountain, he
            states that it is because he found a new job but hated it; when she then asks about his
            grandpa Carlos,
            he
            tells her
            that he's deceased, but they had spent good times before. Apparently, he's the person who
            told Theo
            about
            Celeste
            Mountain and suggested he visits it, albeit rather mysteriously.
            <br><br>
            When Theo asks Madeline who built the temple, Madeline doesn't know, but suggests that it
            was built
            prior to
            everything
            else on the mountain; she then interjects, saying that that might be why Granny lives there.
            She
            interprets
            her as a
            mean person, but one who enjoys living on the mountain. Madeline then asks for the first
            time herself to
            take a selfie
            with Theo (the reverse, where Theo asked Madeline, happened twice, in Old Site and Golden
            Ridge). Theo
            then
            remembers
            that Madeline should be able to reach the summit tomorrow and suggests going to sleep to
            rest well.
            Madeline
            agrees, and
            they both head to sleep.
            <br><br>
            Madeline can also ask to head to sleep earlier, stating that she's tired. In this case, the
            cutscene is
            skipped until
            the selfie sequence.
            <br><br>
            Shortly before dawn, Madeline is transported into another one of her dreams. Northern lights
            appear, the
            campfire turns
            green (like in Old Site), and a single golden feather appears. Starjump intensifies.
            Madeline then flies
            upwards,
            encountering some turquoise-colored Starjump Blocks along the way. Once she makes it past a
            short maze
            consisting solely
            of these blocks, Madeline finds Badeline, where she decides to "set her free" in a bid to
            reclaim
            control
            over herself,
            insulting her in the process and calling her cruelty and manipulativeness out. This ends
            poorly, and
            Badeline chokes her
            using one of many tentacles; she fails to calm herself down with the feather technique. She
            starts then
            falling.
            <br><br>
            “You are not above me. And you can't climb this mountain.”
            ~ Badeline
            <br><br>
            Madeline, awake again, slips onto the edge of the rock bridge she was sleeping on; this
            awakens Theo,
            who
            starts
            freaking out. The rock bridge collapses, destroying a now-unlit campfire and sending
            Madeline flying
            down
            the mountain.
            She lands into what looks like a crystal cave at the foot of the mountain, in a pool of
            water.

            Following the events of Reflection, Madeline heads for the summit again alongside
            Badeline. They help
            each
            other along
            the way. Initially, Badeline remains somewhat distrustful and scared of Maddy; she
            states that she was
            "waiting for
            something to go wrong". They also talk about Mr. Oshiro after passing the 1500M
            checkpoint. Badeline
            eventually flips
            around: as Madeline starts doubting herself once again, Badeline encourages her, stating
            that she can do
            this.

            “I believe in you.”
            ~ Badeline

            As they finally reach the peak, Badeline remembers that she cannot continue to exist
            outside of Celeste
            Mountain simply
            because she is still a part of Madeline. Maddy then comments about how they can still
            work together,
            even if
            she no
            longer has a physical body. They then sit on the summit, enjoying the view for some time
            before climbing
            down.

    <div class="hor-flex">
        <div class="column">
            The events of Core occur approximately one year after Madeline first made it to
            Celeste Mountain's
            summit.
            Madeline
            seems to be on good terms with Badeline, since she still has her double dash, owing
            to the events of
            Reflection.
            Madeline and Granny have been in contact via phone for the past year, and the latter
            had told her about
            a
            cave in the
            mountain; Madeline wanted to explore deeper into it. When she arrives to explore the
            cave, Granny and
            the
            Bird have
            arrived to greet her. The old woman then tells her to follow her.
            <br><br>
            “Doesn't get any deeper than this!”
            ~ Granny, laughing
            <br><br>
            After a simple room which makes Madeline realize that she can no longer refill her
            dash upon simply
            landing
            on the
            ground, Madeline arrives at a small storage room where Granny was waiting for her.
            She proceeds to warn
            the
            mountain
            climber that the mountain's powers will affect her differently this time, because of
            how close she is
            getting to the
            heart of the mountain. Madeline then comments on how she has already noticed that
            (her dashes are now
            much
            more
            limited). Granny then subsequently wishes her friend good luck.
            <br><br>
            Continuing to converse with Granny will make her comment on Badeline, asking where
            she is. Madeline then
            says that she
            doesn't know and was expecting her to show up by now; she even theorizes that
            because she has changed,
            her
            "goth" self
            is no longer a part of her. Granny suggests the opposite, that they have grown
            together and are now
            essentially fused
            into one; the mountain could no longer separate them from each other. Talking to
            Granny again will make
            her
            ask about
            Theo; apparently, he spent the summer in Vancouver, referencing both Theo's
            Instagram account and how
            Maddy
            Thorson
            lives in Vancouver, Canada. Madeline did spend some time with him, but he has
            returned to California for
            the
            moment
            being; Granny states that he seems like a good man. Madeline then asks how Granny
            herself is doing; she
            says
            that
            nothing changed, except she is continuing to become older and older - the mountain,
            however, is keeping
            her
            in shape.
            Madeline then tells her to take care of herself before venturing off. Going past
            this point onward
            requires
            obtaining at
            least four Crystal Hearts to unlock the Crystal Heart Gate.
            <br><br>
            If not enough hearts were collected, Madeline can interact with Granny once again,
            asking about that.
            Granny
            then tells
            Madeline that there is no other way in and that the Mountain thinks she's not ready.
            Madeline complains
            that
            the
            Mountain can't think, Granny explains that it thinks "how a river thinks to flow to
            the sea" and she
            should
            retrace her
            steps and really pay attention.
            <br><br>
            The rest of the chapter does not contain any plot whatsoever, at least until the
            end. Badeline makes a
            cameo
            appearance
            in the form of a Badeline Orb midway through the final checkpoint. The final room
            has much less gravity,
            and
            loops
            vertically; Madeline then wonders if "this is it". A blue crystal heart, aptly named
            Heart of the
            Mountain,
            is located
            here.

            The beginning of Chapter 9 is the same as the end of Summit C-Side. Madeline
            lands on a grassy platform,
            one
            which
            (previously) would lead up to a crystal heart. As Madeline approaches Granny, a
            cutscene trigger occurs,
            and
            Granny
            turns into a gravestone. Lightning strikes, and the pink tree in the background
            loses all its leaves.
            The
            weather turns
            from sunny to gloomy, representing the sudden, unexpected shift in the plot's
            tone. Madeline reacts in a
            very sad tone
            but also shows hints of anger.
            <br><br>
            “Granny... I can't believe you're gone, you old bat.”
            ~ Madeline
            <br><br>
            Badeline then appears, confronting Madeline about how she never attended
            Granny's funeral (which
            presumably
            happens
            sometime between the events of Chapter 8 and Chapter 9); Madeline fell apart
            when she received the news,
            so
            she couldn't
            handle it. The Bird then lands on the gravestone, signaling its presence. It
            then starts flying away,
            and
            Madeline
            starts chasing it via two Badeline orbs and three clouds.
            <br><br>
            The second Badeline orb launches Madeline into space. Badeline becomes
            confrontational during their
            ascent;
            Madeline
            explains that she's chasing the bird because it's a part of Granny. Badeline
            explains that Madeline is
            in
            denial and
            that it's just an ordinary bird. Fear of the Unknown starts playing after this
            cutscene.
            <br><br>
            “Uhh... we're really high up.”
            ~ Badeline
            <br><br>
            Badeline then confronts Madeline again as she lands on a moon block platform in
            space, asking how she
            can
            breathe in
            space. Madeline rejects her attempts at convincing her, becoming aggressive, and
            eventually telling her
            other part to
            leave. From this point onwards, Madeline only has one dash instead of two, but
            is also much more
            determined
            than usual.
            <br><br>
            After navigating through various rooms containing various new elements, such as
            Jellyfish, and older
            objects, such as
            Dream Blocks, Madeline arrives at a large room where the bird can be seen; the
            Power Source room. As it
            flies upwards,
            it seals five key blocks behind, forcing Madeline to retrieve five keys (or skip
            it entirely).
            Navigating
            upwards using
            the Red Bubble in the room, after all keys are unlocked, will lead to another
            room, where the skies will
            turn into a
            paler shade of (albeit mystic) blue. Joy of Remembrance starts playing,
