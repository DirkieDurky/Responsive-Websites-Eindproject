    <h1>Techniques</h1>
    <p>
        Techniques, often simply known as tech, are special moves Madeline can do to enhance her mountain-climbing
        ability. They
        come in a wide range of uses and difficulties. Many can be used to skip sections of a room, or multiple rooms at
        once.
